## Why R?

+ R is free (more specifically GPL3)
+ R is powerful, flexible and often cutting-edge
+ R can be accessed from SAS, SPSS, Stata, Python, Java
+ Interfaces to R are available for Oracle, SAP HANA, Teradata, Netezza, Greenplum

---
## Why R?

+ Standard and cutting-edge statistical modeling
+ Flexible data munging
+ High-quality visualizations
+ Reproducible and automated reporting
+ Increasingly, web-based content-rich graphics

--- .segue .dark

## Let's get started

---

## Where are we?

+ The first thing you want to do is contain all your project-related scripts in a folder
+ All the R data files will be in this folder

```r
getwd() # What is the current working directory?
setwd() # Set the working directory
```

### What's here?

```r
dir()       # shows files in current directory
file.path() # creates a file path string
ls()        # Shows objects in the current session
```
<div style="background-color:lightgrey;">
<p>
RStudio allows you to create "Projects" which hold everything nicely
together along with Git functionality, if desired</p>
</div>

## Some tips on R coding

+ The R Style Guide by Google
+ Comment character `#` can be placed at the beginning or at the right of code
+ Statements are ended with return or semicolon (;)
+ Names in R are quite liberal but it is recommended that you use common naming conventions
  + First character letter, followed by letters, digits, underscores or periods
  + Note that the period has some special meaning and is used often in R naming to separate object names (e.g. customer.name)
  + It is recommended that variable names use underscores instead of dots especially when combining with databases


---

## Data structures in R

+ In R, _everything_ is an object 
  + All objects have a class
  + All objects have a name
  + Objects are created or changed through assignment operators
+ An objectâ€™s class reflects what you can do with the object and the type and extent of information it contains
+ Objects can be passed into functions as a parameter

---

## Assignments

+ `x <- 1:5` or `x <- c(1,3,5,6)`: **integer**
+ `x <- 3.6` or `x <- c(2.5,4.3,9.9)`: **numeric**

+ Basic atomic types are `integer`, `numeric`, `character`, 
`complex`, `logical`, `date`
+ Vectors are 1-dimensional objects of same atomic type. R prefers vectors 

```r
v <- c(1,4,6,7.6)
```

+ Matrices are 2-dimensional objects of same atomic type

```r
A <- matrix(0, nrow=4, ncol=6)
B <- matrix(c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19), nrow=2, byrow=T)
```

---

## Matrices

+ R is fundamentally a matrix-driven language like MATLAB.
+ R has a variety of matrix manipulation functions

```r
nrow(A)
ncol(A)
A[1,]            # First row of A
A[,2]            # Second column of A
A[3,4]           # (3,4) element of A
A[1:2, c(2,5,6)] # a submatrix of A
A %*% B          # matrix multiplication
```

+ R starts counting at 1, not 0

---
## Matrices

+ Some more functions

```r
det(A)
solve(A) # Gives matrix inverse
solve(A,b) # Solves equation Ax=b
eigen(A)
svd(A)
```

+ R can be compiled with high-performance LAPACK and BLAS linear algebra
libraries

---

## The `data.frame` object

+ The `data.frame` is a special form of a `list`
+ A `list` is a data structure that can contain heterogeneous types of data

```r
L <- list(a=1:3, b=c('rhino','bear'), c = matrix(c(1,2,3,4),nrow=2))
```

---
## The `data.frame` object

+ The `data.frame` is the workhorse of R
+ A `data.frame` is essentially a list of vectors of the same length
  + Each vector may be of a different type
+ A `data.frame` is represented as a table, with columns being the vectors
+ Think of a `data.frame` as a collection of variables
+ You can manipulate a `data.frame` like a matrix
  + `D[1,]` or `D[,1:2]`
  + It is <u>not</u> a matrix
+ You can extract variables 
  + `D$index` or `D[,'index']` (recall data frames have columnar representation)
+ Data frames act like SQL tables
  + You can join them (`merge`) and append to them (`cbind`, `rbind`)

---

## The `factor` type

+ Factors are R's representation of categorical variables
+ Factors look like vectors of characters, but they are not!!

```r
gender = factor(c('M','M','F','M','F','F','F'))
levels(gender)
is.factor(gender)
is.character(gender)
as.numeric(gender)
```
+ Internally, factors are represented as integers, with each 
integer corresponding to a level of the categorical variable

---
## Functions

Functions in R have the syntax

```r
functionname <- function(inp1, inp2=3, ...){

  statements
  
  return(list of output objects)

}
```

+ If the `return` statement is absent, the function returns the last 
object created.
+ `...` signifies optional parameters
+ You would use this as `results <- functionname(inp1=x, inp2=4, inp3=9)`
+ Functions are objects

---

## The R REPL

+ R's console is a REPL (read-eval-print loop)
+ You can type commands directly into the console
+ Entering an object name prints out the object's value

```{r echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
a <- 1
a
```

---
## The R REPL

+ R's console is a REPL (read-eval-print loop)
+ You can type commands directly into the console
+ Entering an object name prints out the object's value

```{r echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
dir
```

---
## The R REPL


```{r echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
L <- list(a=c(1,3,4,6), 
          b = c('Adam','Eve'), 
          c = matrix(c(1,2,3,4),nrow=2))
L

```

---
## R packages

+ R has over 5000 packages contributed by users
  + CRAN (general)
  + Bioconductor (bioinformatics)
  + Omegahat (interfaces)
+ Packages make our lives simpler
  + Stand on the shoulders of giants (or simply, people)
+ <b>Conventions:</b> `Hmisc::describe` is the object `describe` in the package `Hmisc`
+ Packages are loaded into the current session using `library(pkgname)` or `require(pkgname)`

## Getting started with data

---
## Importing data

+ <b>Delimited data</b> with comma, tab, pipe using `read.table`, `read.csv`, `read.delim`
+ <b>Fixed width</b> with `read.fwf`
+ <b>Excel</b> with `gdata::read.xls`, `XLConnect::readWorksheet`, `xlsx::read.xlsx`
+ <b>SAS</b> with `Hmisc::sas.get`, `foreign:read.ssd` (both requiring SAS), `sas7bdat::read.sas7bdat` (for Windows sas7bdat files), or via conversion to Stata `.dta` files
+ <b>SPSS</b> with `foreign::read.sav`
+ <b>Stata</b> with `foreign::read.dta`
+ <b> JSON</b> with `rjson::fromJSON`

*** pnotes
+ Note you can read from both local files and URLs 


---
## Importing data

+ <b> Databases </b>
  + `RODBC`/`RJDBC`/`DBI` (general)
  + `sqldf`
  + `RMySQL` (not on Windows)
  + `RMongo`

--- .segue .dark

## Programming 

---

## Conditionals

R has a general `if-else` paradigm available

```r
if(condition) {
  statements
} else if {
  statements
} else {
  statements
}
```
Conditions include equality (`==`), inequalities (`<` or `<=`), or (`|`), and (`&`) and negation (`!`)
<p>
If the conditional only applies to a vector, R provides a `ifelse` function:
```r
x <- ifelse(y > 0, 'Positive','Negative')
```

---
## Loops

R provides

+ `for` loops
+ `while` loops
+ `repeat` loops

```r
for(i in 1:25){
  y[i] <- 3*x[i]+5
}

for(u in letters){
  print(u)
}
```

It is better to avoid explicit looping, if possible

---
## 'Apply'ing yourself

R provides a set of "apply" functions:
+ `apply` works on arrays 

```r
apply(X,1, mean)  # Mean of the rows
apply(X, 2, sd)   # Std. Dev. of the columns
```
+ `lapply` works on lists
  + It also works on `data.frame` objects, by column

```r
lapply(L, FUN) # applies FUN to every element of L
```

+ `sapply` is `lapply` with the output simplified

---

### Set operations
```r
union, intersection, %in%, setdiff, setequals
```

### Pattern matching
```r
grep, grepl, regexpr, sub, gsub
```

### Type verification
```r
is.numeric, is.factor, is.list, is.data.frame, is.character
```

### Type conversion
```r
as.numeric, as.factor, as.data.frame, as.character
```

---

## Looking at data frames

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

---

## Looking at data frames

```{r}
summary(mtcars[,1:4])
```

----
## Looking at data frames

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
Hmisc::describe(mtcars[,1:2])
```

---

## Subsetting

```{r}
subset(mtcars, mpg < 20 & cyl==6)
```

---
## Transforming

```{r}
cars2 <- transform(mtcars,
                   gas = ifelse(mpg>20,'Econ','Guzzler'),
                   kmpg = mpg * 1.6)
```
Note that the original data remains unchanged
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

---
## Data cleaning

### Missing values
+ Missing values are coded as `NA`
+ R can test for missing values using `is.na`
+ Rows of data frames with complete data can be identified using 
`complete.cases(D)`

### Duplication
+ You can get a set of non-duplicate rows of a data frame using 
`D[!duplicated(D),]`.

---
## Statistical functions

### Probability distributions
```r
beta,binom, cauchy, chisq, xp, f, gamma, geom, 
hyper, lnorm, logis, nbinom, norm, pois, t, 
unif, weibull, wilcox.
```
Each has a random number generator (`rnorm`), a density function (`dnorm`), a quantile function (`qnorm`) and a probability function (`pnorm`)

### Statistical tests
```r
t.test, wilcox.test, chisq.test, prop.test
```

---
## Aggregation
We will use the package `plyr` for demonstration. The general format is 

```r
ddply(data frame, spliting variables, function, function arguments)
```
```{r}
avg.by.cyl.gear <- ddply(mtcars, ~cyl + gear, summarise, mean.mpg = mean(mpg, 
    na.rm = T), median.mpg = median(mpg, na.rm = T))
avg.by.cyl.gear
```

---
## Aggregation

`plyr` has a set of functions of the form `(x)(y)ply` where `(x)` and `(y)` can be `d`,`l`, or `a`.`(x)` is the class of the input object and 
`(y)` is the class of the output object, among `data.frame`, `list` and `array`

|      Input       |  data.frame  |  list  |  array  |
|:----------------:|:------------:|:------:|:-------:|
|  **data.frame**  |    ddply     | ldply  |  adply  |
|     **list**     |    dlply     | llply  |  alply  |
|    **array**     |    daply     | laply  |  aaply  |

---
## Splitting

```{r}
library(plyr)
cars2 <- subset(mtcars, mpg<20)
dlply(cars2,~cyl)
```

## Modeling

### The formula interface

R has a `formula` object which is a representation of a formula specifying
the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables

+ <b> Basic formula:</b> `y ~ a + b`
+ <b>Interactions:</b> `y~ a + b + a:b` or `y ~ a*b`
+ <b>Including transformations:</b> `y ~ a + sqrt(b)`

Factors are implicitly handled correctly

---
## Models

### Classical models

+ <b>Linear models:</b> `lm`
+ <b>Generalized linear models:</b> `glm`
+ <b>Mixed effects models:</b> `lme4::lmer` or `nlme::lme`

### Machine learning

+ <b>Random Forest:</b> `randomForest::randomForest`
+ <b>Decision trees:</b> `rpart::rpart`
+ <b>Neural Networks:</b> `caret::nnet`
+ <b>Lasso:</b> `lars::lars`

---
